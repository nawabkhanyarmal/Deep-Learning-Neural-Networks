# 🧠 Deep Learning & Neural Networks 

## 👋 Introduction
This repository is a **student portfolio showcasing Deep Learning and Neural Network projects**. It includes implementations of:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification and feature extraction  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and LSTM/GRU for sequence modeling and NLP tasks  
- **Autoencoders** for data compression, reconstruction, and anomaly detection  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** for image generation  
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for advanced computer vision tasks  
- **Transformers & attention models** for NLP tasks (text classification, sentiment analysis, embeddings)

The projects demonstrate the **end-to-end deep learning workflow**, from data preprocessing and model design to training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
